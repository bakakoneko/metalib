unless the source of this library or binaries generated by it is distributed. This does not include files generated from
your software. For example, if you copy the headers from Metalib into your own project, you must include the notices
with the header files. Additionally, you must also include the notices if you somehow manage to compile Metalib as a
static or dynamic library and distribute those binaries. However, if you only distribute your program in binary form,
compiling with the Metalib headers, you do not have to include the notices with the binary but you do have to include
them with the source if you choose to distribute it.
